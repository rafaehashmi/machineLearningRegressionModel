"# Machine-Learning-Model--Price_Regression" 

In this project, we're going to use machine learning to predict the auction sale price for a piece of heavy equipment to create a "blue book" for bulldozers.

The question to ask is:
How well can we predict the future sale price of a bulldozer, given its characterisitcs and previous examples of how much other bulldozers have been sold for?
